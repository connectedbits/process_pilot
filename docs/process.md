# Processes

## Process

A process is the work someone (or something) does to accomplish an objective. A process represents a sequence of steps in the form of a graph.

## CallActivity (WIP)

A CallActivity invokes a process that is defined external to the model enabling reuse.

## SubProcess (WIP)

A SubProcess (Embedded, Event, or AdHoc) has parts that are modeled in a child-level process, a process with its own step flows and start and end states.
